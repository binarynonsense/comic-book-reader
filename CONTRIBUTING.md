Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

I'm not looking for code contributions, as I want to keep this as a personal project, but bug reports and feature suggestions are always welcome (you can use the [issues section](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/issues) of the repository to leave feedback), as well as [pull requests](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/pulls) with new [localization files](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/tree/master/app/assets/i18n) or [documentation](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/tree/master/docs) translations for other languages (no machine translations, please) that, ideally, you'd be willing to update when new entries are added to the files. 

If you want to update or have suggestions about already available localization files and/or documents, please create an issue to talk about it and check if they have an active maintainer, to propose the changes to them, before creating a pull request.

If you want to create a new localization file for another language, I suggest using the [English one](https://github.com/binarynonsense/comic-book-reader/blob/master/src/assets/i18n/en.json) as a starting point.
