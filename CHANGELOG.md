# v3.12.1

- Added a .flatpak package for Linux that, as an alternative to the recently added .deb, should run in distributions, like Ubuntu 24.04, where the regular and AppImage versions have trouble to by default for not having an AppArmor profile.

Periodically, the program will look during its start process for a newer stable version of ACBR on GitHub and show a small notification if there's one (if you click it, it will open the corresponding release page in the system's browser).
